### Getting Started

Json rule editor is an unornamented web interface tool to manage your business rules and decision outcomes. A single page application to effortlesly upload / create business rules via json files. Since the lightweight libraries are the new normal in web applications, possessing logics in json file will be a effective way to manage the application code. Having said that redudancy can be detoured by discarding the other business rule file format such as xml or excel, which is often hectic to parse and adding complications to developer.

Process to implement json rule file in your application follows

- Generate rule file using json rule editor
- Place the generated file in your application folder,
- and pass the relative path of file and input parameters into json rules engine to get the output.

Facinating feature it implies is, we can validate the business decisions instantly once after rules are added. Thus, ensuring expected outcome is returned from the rule sheet before generates the file. Consequently it eliminates issues at first place when rules are being created instead of identifing at later stage of development or testing.
